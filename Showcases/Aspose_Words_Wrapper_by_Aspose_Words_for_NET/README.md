You can [use Aspose.Words for .NET via COM Interop](https://docs.aspose.com/display/wordsnet/Use+Aspose.Words+for+.NET+via+COM+Interop). However, if you need to use many of the Aspose.Words for .NET’s classes, methods and properties, you should consider creating a wrapper assembly (using C# or any other .NET programming language), that will help to avoid using Aspose.Words directly from unmanaged code.

This wrapper project demonstrates COM Interop developers who are using scripting languages such as ASP, Delphi, JScript, Perl, PHP, PowerBuilder, Python, VBScript, Visual Basic as to how they can consume required Aspose.Words for .NET’s functionalities which cannot be accessed directly from scripting.

This is really a basic project. But you can use this as a start point and freely create your own wrapper assembly containing the classes and their methods you require. For example, if you want to work with Shapes, you can add a WShape.cs and add new functions to get ChildNodes, get NodeType and so on.
